## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

In this project I use Python 3 and the following support libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

The `requirements.txt` file list all Python libraries that my notebooks
depend on. Use the following command to install:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.

I chose [House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/code?competitionId=5407&sortBy=voteCount) on Kaggle. 

Valuing a home is not easy for everyone, both sellers and buyers. Learning the rules to determine the value of a home from previously collected information is an interesting job.

Using this dataset, I will answer three questions:

Q1: What factors influence the price of a house ('SalePrice') the most?

Q2: Is there any way to predict the price of a house ('SalePrice')?

Q3: How to extract higher-order information from the original features, in other words how to reduce the number of features and still be able to predict the house price with no loss of accuracy?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The house-prices folder contains all the data to use. Detailed information about the data you can see at the link datasets above
